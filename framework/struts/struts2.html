<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>POJO forms and POJO actions</b> - Struts2 has done away with the Action Forms that were an integral part of the Struts framework. With Struts2, you can use any POJO to receive the form input. Similarly, you can now see any POJO as an Action class.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Tag support</b> - Struts2 has improved the form tags and the new tags allow the developers to write less code.</p></li>
<li><p><b>AJAX support</b> - Struts2 has recognised the take over by Web2.0 technologies, and has integrated AJAX support into the product by creating AJAX tags, that function very similar to the standard Struts2 tags.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy Integration</b> - Integration with other frameworks like Spring, Tiles and SiteMesh is now easier with a variety of integration available with Struts2.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Template Support</b> - Support for generating views using templates.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Plugin Support</b> - The core Struts2 behaviour can be enhanced and augmented by the use of plugins. A number of plugins are available for Struts2.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Profiling</b> - Struts2 offers integrated profiling to debug and profile the application. In addition to this, Struts also offers integrated debugging with the help of built in debugging tools.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy to modify tags</b> - Tag markups in Struts2 can be tweaked using Freemarker templates. This does not require JSP or java knowledge. Basic HTML, XML and CSS knowledge is enough to modify the tags.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Promote less configuration</b> - Struts2 promotes less configuration with the help of using default values for various settings. You don't have to configure something unless it deviates from the default settings set by Struts2.</p></li>
<li><p><b>View Technologies:</b> - Struts2 has a great support for multiple view options (JSP, Freemarker, Velocity and XSLT)</p></li>
